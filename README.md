⚔️ Super Leo Lig is an on-chain football manager game that leverages the privacy that Aleo provides to hide players' strategies from opponents.

⚙️ Built using Leo, React and Javascript.

- 🧾 **ZK proofs**: Players compute proof that they use a valid strategy and commit to their strategy on-chain.
- ⛓️ **Smart contracts**: Verifies strategies and winner. After this tokens can be distributed to winners
- 🖼️ **Frontend**: Results are generated in the browser based on strategies.
